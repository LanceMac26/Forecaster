# Forecaster
A website that forecasts profits based on standardized data sets

There are a lot of data sets that are very standardized for most companies. 
This includes accounting data which is usually based on cost centers, accounts, line descriptions, and finally the actual transaction cost.

What is great about the standardization of any data set, is that it makes it easy to create analytics on top of said data sets. 
Why not create a standardized dashboard that can help companies predict spend, see monthly outgoings, and possibly help them improve their spending.

For this project you will probably have to spend a lot of time learning about how to make sure you keep your data secure. 
Of course, we recommend first trying to build the modules that focus on uptaking and standardizing the data and displaying it, before you go too deep into security. 
Thatâ€™s a rabbit hole you may never escape!
